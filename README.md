Create and deploy a running instance of a web server using a configuration management tool of your choice. The web server should serve one page with the following content.

Secure this application and host such that only appropriate ports are publicly exposed and any http requests are redirected to https. This should be automated using a configuration management tool of your choice and you should feel free to use a self-signed certificate for the web server.

Develop and apply automated tests to validate the correctness of theserver configuration.

Express everything in code and provide your code via a Git repository in GitHub.
